## Project Selection

The projects on which the approach is implemented are chosen based on two primary criteria:

* **Decomposition strategy:** The microservices project follow the DDD principle [[3]](https://github.com/FrHassan/MicroservicesProjects#References) for their microservices boundaries identification.

* **Documentation:** The chosen projects have thorough documentation and provide information on their design and implementation."

## Project Analysis
### Platform and Tools

The main utilized tool to apply the methodology is Neo4j [[4]](https://neo4j.com/).

Neo4j offers three main tools to perform graph manipulate graphs: 

* **Neo4j Browser [[5]](https://neo4j.com/developer/neo4j-browser/):** A tool to interact and manipulate graphs. 
* **Neo4j Bloom [[6]](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom/):** A tool to interact visually with the graph.
* **Neo4j NEuler [[7]](https://neo4j.com/developer/graph-data-science/neuler-no-code-graph-algorithms/):** A playground to execute graph algorithms.

### Application of the Methodology

To apply the methodology, we kindly request that you adhere to the provided instructions below.

**1.** Install _Neo4j Desktop_ following the instructions mentioned in [[8]](https://neo4j.com/docs/desktop-manual/current/installation/download-installation/).  
**2.** Use _Neo4j Desktop_ to create a new graph database.  

<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Desktop Create DB.png" width="70%">
</p>

**3.** Under the database "_Plugins_" section, install "_APOC_" and "_Graph Data Science Library_". 
   - _Awesome Procedures On Cypher (APOC)_ [[9]](https://neo4j.com/labs/apoc/) adds a lot of useful_ Cypher_ functionalities that help manipulating the data. 
   - _Graph Data Science Library_ [[10]](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/) will make it easier for us to execute the available Neo4j graph algorithms.

<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Desktop Plugins.PNG" width="70%">
</p>

**4.** Click on the "_Start_" button to run the database.  
   - Whenever the database is operational, Neo4j will indicate an active state with a green color.

</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Desktop DB Running.PNG" width="70%">
</p>

**5.** Under the "_Open_" list, open _Neo4j Browser_.  
**6.** Create the microservices architecture associated graph using the "_Cypher_"  [[11]](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/current/clauses/create/) (You can take inspiration from the code escorted to each existing project in this repository).
   - Now you can manipulate as you want the graph using _Cypher Query Language_ [[12]](https://neo4j.com/developer/cypher/).  

<p align="center">

</p>

<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Desktop Match Graph.PNG" width="70%">
</p>

**7.** Under the "_Graph Apps_" section, open "Graph Data Science Playground" aka _NEuler_.  
   - In case _NEuler_ is absent from the list, you can install it using this url:: [https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neuler](https://neo.jfrog.io/neo/api/npm/npm/neuler)
   - Copy the url and click on "Install".
<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Desktop Graph Apps.PNG">
</p>

**8.** With _NEuler_, you have the ability to utilize all the graph algorithms that are currently at your disposal.
   - Ensure that you activate the "Store result?" checkbox and make a note of the "Write Property" option as it will be utilized later to save the acquired outcomes.
   - The official documentation provides comprehensive information on all the Neo4j graph algorithms that are available [[13]](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/algorithms/).

</p>

**9)** When accessing Neo4j Browser, employ the _Cypher_ match query [[14]](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.4/clauses/match/) to retrieve the desired results. Following that, you have the option to export the results in a format of your choice, typically CSV.


<p align="center">
 <img src="Assets/Images/Neo4j Export CSV.PNG" width="70%">
</p>

**10)** Using the (.csv) file, you have the option to utilize a suitable tool in order to produce visual representations of your architectural data. 
   - In our case, we use _Microsoft Power BI Desktop_ [[15]](https://www.microsoft.com/fr-fr/download/details.aspx?id=58494) to generate our charts.
   - Example of a chart: [Food to Go (FTGO) - Degree analysis](https://github.com/FrHassan/MicroservicesProjects/blob/main/Microservices-Projects/Food%20to%20Go%20(FTGO)/Degree/FTGO%20Degree%20and%20Degree_Out%20(PNG).PNG)

</p>

**Note**: _Neo4j Bloom_ will give you the possibility to explore and visualize your graph interactively. You can use it to provide a visual representation of your graph.
