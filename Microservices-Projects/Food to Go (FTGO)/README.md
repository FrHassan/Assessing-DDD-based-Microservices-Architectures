## Overview

Food to Go (FTGO) [[1]](https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application) is an enterprise Java-based application designed for managing restaurants and food delivery. The main feature of FTGO lies in the utilization of DDD to identify and decompose its set of services. FTGO implements DDD by following the steps presented in section 2-1. This approach leads to the creation of distinct sub-domains, each having its own defined Bounded Context. Figure 1 presents some of the FTGOâ€™s sub-domains such as Order, Consumer, and Delivery sub-domains. Each of the services in FTGO has a single responsibility and is considered small in terms of granularity, containing only the needed entities to ensure their functioning, allowing to be developed by dedicated small teams.

## FTGO Microservices architecture into a graph

During this phase of the methodology, the architecture associated graph for is generated and shown in the Figure below.

## Graph algorithms execution on FTGO

The second phase of the methodology invovles executing the graph algorithms on the FTGO associated graph. The following table presents the obtained results from this execution. The rows highlighted in red show the services that exceed the threshold of the Degree Centrality Afferent Coupling, while for the other algorithms, the metrics for the services that surpass the thresholds are indicated in red with the tiny character '1'.

## FTGO result analysis

The Degree Centrality Afferent Coupling algorithm has identified 3 services (Order, Kitchen, and Restaurant) with differing levels of incoming dependencies, ranging from 4 to 6. This suggests that modifications to any of these services will require corresponding changes in at least 4 services, which refers to an important level of Design-Time Coupling. Additionally, the other algorithms have confirmed the findings of the Degree Centrality Afferent Coupling algorithm, with the 3 services showing significant values for these algorithms except for the "\textit{Restaurant}" service in regards to the LCC algorithm.

## Proposed architecture

In this section involves proposing refactoring actions to reduce the degree of Design-Time coupling in the architecture. The proposed architecture is illustrated in the following Figures.

The following step is to execute the graph algorithms on the newly proposed refactored architecture. The following Table presents the metrics of the proposed refactored architecture along with the metrics of the initial architecture. The metrics denoted by a green '1' represent a decrease in comparison to the metrics of the initial architecture. In the following, the proposed refactored architecture's obtained results are analyzed. Then, these results are compared to the findings of the initial architecture to check the variation in the level of Design-Time Coupling.

The overall results indicate that the proposed refactored architecture has experienced a decrease in all metrics, without any observed increase. The Degree Centrality Afferent Coupling algorithm has only shown a decrease in the number of incoming dependencies for the Delegate Order" service (previously the "Order" service). However, there have been no increases regarding the metrics of the other services. According to the PageRank algorithm, 9 services were identified as having lower importance rankings based on the number of incoming dependencies, which confirms the reduction in terms of the number of dependencies per service. Hence, the level of Design-Time Coupling between these services decreases. Regarding the Triangle Count algorithm, significant progress has been made in terms of reducing the number of three-sided dependencies across a total of 9 services. Additionally, there is an important decrease across 8 services in terms of the Local Clustering Coefficient with no increase at any service, which indicates that the level of Design-Time Coupling has been reduced in comparison to the initial architecture. However, this new refactored architecture comes with a cost, which is the increase in the number of microservices within the overall architecture.
