## Overview

Food to Go (FTGO) [[1]](https://github.com/microservices-patterns/ftgo-application) is an enterprise Java-based application designed for managing restaurants and food delivery. The main feature of FTGO lies in the utilization of DDD to identify and decompose its set of services. FTGO implements DDD by following the steps presented in section 2-1. This approach leads to the creation of distinct sub-domains, each having its own defined Bounded Context. Figure 1 presents some of the FTGOâ€™s sub-domains such as Order, Consumer, and Delivery sub-domains. In the case of FTGO, each Bounded Context corresponds to one microservice. Each of these services has a single responsibility and is considered small in terms of granularity, containing only the needed entities to ensure their functioning, allowing to be developed by dedicated small teams.
